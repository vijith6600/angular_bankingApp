                angular - front end technology


1. To create a project - ng new projectName / ng new projectName --rowting

2. To run angular project - ng serve / ng servr --open

3. To generate component - ng g c componentName

4. To generate service - ng g s serviceName



                Building blocks of angular

1. Module - To import libraries (root module - App module)

2. Component  - To create view (Html,css,ts,specification) - (root component -App component)

3. share data inside a comonent like ts to html
                1. one way binding - data shareing in only one direction
                2. component to view (ts file to html)
                        => string interpolaton - {{expression}}
                        => property binding - [attribute name]="property name
                
                3. view to component (html to ts)
                        => event binding - (event-name)="function()"
                        =>event binding using $event - (event-name)="function($event)"

                        => Using Template referencing variable - #variable-name

                4. Two way binding - data sharing in both direction at the same time

                        => ngmodel - import FormsModule in AppModule -[(ngModel)]="Variable-name"

                5. Angular Routing - used to set the path for Component in appRowtingModule

                        => use router-outlet selector in root component

                6. Dependency Injection [imp]

                7.angular service to database to acess in diffrent code

                8.(ngSubmit)=function() call

                9. Angular Diractive - To manipulate DOM stractive

                        => Component Directive
                        => Structural Directive - prefixed by *
                                
                                => *ngFor
                                => *ngIf

                        => Attribute Directive ngClass
                                
                
                10, Angular Form

                        => Template Driven Form ()
                        => Model Driven Form  - Design model in Ts file
                               
                                > Reactive Forms - FORM group , Array, Control
                                        >import REactiveFormsModule


                11, local storage

                        =>setItem
                        =>getItem
                        =>removeItem

                12, Parent - child Cmmunication

                        =>parent to child - Input
                        =>Child to parent - Output

                13, Angular pipe

                14, Front end server side integration 


                       => import HttpClient module
                       => Inject HttpClient
                       => Call api using HttpClient

                15, Asynchronous Call - RxJS

                        => Observable

                                => resolved - sunscribe()
                                => reject - catch()
